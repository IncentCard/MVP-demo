# MVP-demo
A work in progress demo of the MVP features that will eventually be added to the first official build

Things in the 'app' folder are from an older version of the demo that used a Node API server before the rest of the project was converted to React. At some point the API server should be built properly and integrated back into the React demo.

To run the demo run "npm run build" then open the index.html file located in 'src'
